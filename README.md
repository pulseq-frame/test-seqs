# ![Pulseq Logo](https://pulseq.github.io/logo.png) Test Sequences

This repository contains [pulseq](https://pulseq.github.io/) sequences that can be used to test importers, simulations etc...

In the future, expected outputs or measurements might be added.

## PyPulseq Example Sequences

The corresponding folder contains all example files provided by [pypulseq](https://github.com/imr-framework/pypulseq) 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4. Execute generate.py to create all .seq files. This script will create a new virtual python environment in which the corresponding pypulseq versions are installed to avoid modifying the python installation on your system.

```console
> python pypulseq/generate/generate.py
```
